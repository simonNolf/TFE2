Host key verification failed.
Error: Process completed with exit code 255.
ChatGPT

The error message "Host key verification failed" typically occurs when trying to connect to a remote server using SSH (Secure Shell), and the host key of the server does not match the key stored in your local known_hosts file. This issue is a security measure to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

    Check Host Key:
    Ensure that the host key of the remote server hasn't changed unexpectedly. This can happen if the server has been reinstalled or if there's a security issue. If you're sure it's safe, you can update the known_hosts file.

    Update known_hosts:
    Open the known_hosts file on your local machine (usually located in ~/.ssh/known_hosts) and remove the line corresponding to the remote server. The next time you connect, the correct key will be added to the file.

    css

ssh-keygen -R <hostname or IP address>

Replace <hostname or IP address> with the actual address of the server.

Verify Connection:
Try connecting to the server again. SSH should prompt you to add the new key to the known_hosts file. Type 'yes' to add the key.

css

ssh username@hostname

Check Permissions:
Ensure that the permissions on the ~/.ssh directory and the known_hosts file are set correctly. The ~/.ssh directory should have permissions 700, and the known_hosts file should have permissions 600.

bash

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Use StrictHostKeyChecking:
As a temporary solution, you can disable strict host key checking by adding the following flag when connecting:

perl

    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no username@hostname

    Be cautious when using this option, as it removes a layer of security.

If the issue persists, you may need to investigate further by checking server logs and ensuring the server is configured correctly.

If you are encountering the "Host key verification failed" error in the context of GitHub Actions, it might be due to the runner environment not having the necessary SSH configuration or known_hosts setup. Here are some steps to address the issue:

    Update known_hosts:
    In your GitHub Actions workflow, you can add a step to update the known_hosts file before attempting any SSH-related operations. This can be done using a script like the following:

    yaml

- name: Update known_hosts
  run: |
    ssh-keyscan -H <hostname or IP address> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

Replace <hostname or IP address> with the actual address of the server.

Use StrictHostKeyChecking:
As a workaround, you can also use the -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no option when executing SSH commands. However, keep in mind that this bypasses host key checking and might introduce security risks.

yaml

- name: SSH into the server
  run: |
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no username@hostname "your command here"

Consider using this option only if you are confident about the security implications and if updating the known_hosts file doesn't resolve the issue.

Check SSH Configuration:
Make sure that the SSH configuration is correctly set up in your GitHub Actions workflow. Ensure that the private key used for authentication is correctly configured, and the necessary SSH environment variables are set.

yaml

- name: SSH into the server
  run: |
    ssh -i /path/to/private/key username@hostname "your command here"

Replace /path/to/private/key with the actual path to your private key.

Debugging:
You can add additional debugging steps to gather more information about the issue. For example, print the contents of the known_hosts file, check the SSH configuration, and examine any logs related to the GitHub Actions workflow.

yaml

    - name: Debug
      run: |
        cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        ssh -vvv username@hostname "your command here"

    The -vvv option increases the verbosity of the SSH output, providing more details about the connection process.

Make sure to adapt these steps according to your specific use case and GitHub Actions workflow. If the problem persists, examining the specific details of the workflow, including logs and configuration, can help in diagnosing and resolving the issue.

To address the "Host key verification failed" issue in your GitHub Actions workflow, you can modify the webfactory/ssh-agent step to include the known_hosts update step. Here's the modified workflow:

yaml

name: Test Ionic (jest) and Deploy to VPS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 14
    - name: Install dependencies and run Ionic tests
      run: |
        cd frontend
        npm install
        npm i @ionic/react-test-utils
        npm run test.unit
        cd ..

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.KEY_SSH }}
      VPS_USER: ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}
      VPS_IP: ${{ secrets.VPS_IP }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Update known_hosts
      run: |
        ssh-keyscan -H ${{ secrets.VPS_IP }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

    - name: webfactory/ssh-agent
      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
      with:
        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.KEY_SSH }}

    - name: Deploy to VPS
      run: |
        ssh ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}@${{ secrets.VPS_IP }} /bin/bash << EOF
          cd TFE2
          git pull

          cd frontend
          npm install
          npm i @ionic/react-test-utils
          npm run test.unit
          cd ..

          docker stop serveur_web || true
          docker rm serveur_web || true

          docker build -t mon_projet_web .
          docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name serveur_web mon_projet_web
          exit
        EOF

This modification adds a step before the webfactory/ssh-agent step to update the known_hosts file with the host key of your VPS. The ssh-keyscan command is used to fetch and append the host key to the known_hosts file.

Remember to replace /path/to/TFE2 with the actual path to your TFE2 project on the VPS. Also, make sure to adjust any other paths or configuration as needed for your specific setup.
